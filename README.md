# üè¶ Multi-Agent Financial Intelligence Platform (LangGraph Version)

This project implements a modern multi-agent financial intelligence platform using **LangGraph**, open-source LLMs, and market data tools. It processes natural language investment queries, handles spelling errors and company names if ticker symbols are incorrect, extracts the most recent ticker symbols using search tools like Tavily, scrapes market and qualitative data from sources such as Yahoo Finance and news sites, performs in-depth analysis, and delivers structured, actionable recommendations, including price charts and portfolio allocation suggestions.

The system integrates crawler scripts, multiple LLM-driven agents, and external APIs to deliver high-quality insights for investors, analysts, and automated trading tools.

## üìä Data Flow

The workflow is carried out in the following stages:

1. **User Query**

   - The input can be a **natural language query**, e.g., "invest in renewable energy" or "Apple company."
   - Alternatively, it can be a **ticker symbol**, e.g., `AAPL`, `TSLA`.
   - The query is sent to the **Ticker Inference Agent**, which extracts the relevant ticker symbol.

2. **Ticker Inference Agent**

   - If the input is a valid ticker, it directly returns the ticker.
   - If the input is a company name or a **misspelled ticker**, it infers the most relevant ticker symbol.
   - If the input contains an **outdated ticker symbol**, it finds and returns the current symbol (e.g., `FB` ‚Üí `META`).
   - This ensures that all downstream agents use the correct ticker symbol.

3. **Crawler Agent**

   - Fetches data from multiple sources, including:
     - Yahoo Finance
     - Finnhub
     - Tavily
     - NewsAPI
   - It generates raw summaries, financial metrics, and news content for the selected ticker.

4. **Analysis Agent (Groq LLaMA)**

   - Performs both quantitative and qualitative analysis on the crawled data.
   - Provides stock outlook summaries based on the collected data.

5. **Recommender Agent**

   - Generates actionable investment guidance, such as:
     - Buy / Hold / Sell recommendations
     - Portfolio allocation suggestions
     - Risk management strategies
