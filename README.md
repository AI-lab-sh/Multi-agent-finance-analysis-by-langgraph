# üè¶ Multi-Agent Financial Intelligence Platform (langgraph version)

This project implements a modern multi-agent financial intelligence platform using **LangGraph**, open-source LLMs, and market data tools. It handles natural language investment queries(handling misspels and company names if not correct ticker symbols provided), extracts the most recent ticker symbols using search tools like Tavily, scrapes market and qualitative data from online sources like Yahoo Finance and newes sites, performs deep analysis, and delivers structured, actionable recommendations.

The system integrates crawler scripts, multiple LLM-driven agents, and external APIs to deliver high-quality insights for investors, analysts, and automated trading tools.

## üìä Data Flow

The workflow proceeds in stages:

1. **User Query**

   * Can be a **natural language query**, e.g., "invest in renewable energy" or "Apple company".
   * Can also be a **ticker symbol**, e.g., `AAPL`, `TSLA`.
   * The query is sent to the **Ticker Inference Agent** to extract the relevant ticker symbol.

2. **Ticker Inference Agent**

   * If the user input is a valid ticker, it returns the ticker.
   * If the input is a company name or a **misspelled ticker**, it infers the most relevant ticker symbol.
   * If the input is an **old/outdated ticker symbol**, it finds the current updated symbol (e.g., `FB` ‚Üí `META`).
   * This guarantees that all downstream agents use the correct ticker symbol.

3. **Crawler Agent**

   * Fetches data from multiple sources:

     * Yahoo Finance
     * Finnhub
     * Tavily
     * NewsAPI
   * Produces raw summaries, financial metrics, and news content for the selected ticker.

4. **Analysis Agent (Groq LLaMA)**

   * Performs quantitative and qualitative analysis on the crawled data.
   * Produces stock outlook summaries.

5. **Recommender Agent**

   * Generates actionable investment guidance:

     * Buy / Hold / Sell recommendations
     * Portfolio allocation suggestions
     * Risk management strategies
